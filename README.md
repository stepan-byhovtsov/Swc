# Stormworks classification
Stormworks classification (SWC) is a platform for working with stormworks creations (microcontrollers, vehicles, etc.). The core of the platform is a unified template for all types of in-game objects.

####         With SWC you can:
* Classify your works to inject them into the SWC world. You can use our GUI application for Windows.
* Save them to a database to make them visible for other users. SWC uses MongoDB as it's database.
* Find a work that meets all your requirements in the database, that you have access to. You can use filtering and sorting tool in our GUI application.
* Manipulate your vehicles. For example, you have a jet fighter, that is classified in SWC, and you want to find a missile for it. You search using SWC, find your missile and can insert it into your jet file to immediately spawn it.
* You can add your own extensions based on SWC to add more functionality.
